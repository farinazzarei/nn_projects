# more Neural Network with Pytorch

In this project, we implemented a neural network using the PyTorch library on the CHEST-MNIST dataset. This dataset is
multi-label with 14 classes. A key challenge is that it is highly imbalancedâ€”some diseases occur very rarely, meaning
most labels are inactive for the majority of patients. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets,
and tuned the number of epochs and hidden layers based on validation loss. While the training and validation losses
reached acceptable values, the scikit-learn evaluation metrics did not perform well due to the class imbalance and the
large number of inactive labels.
